description: Alaz is an open-source Anteon eBPF agent that can inspect and collect Kubernetes (K8s) service traffic without the need for code instrumentation, sidecars, or service restarts. Alaz can create a Service Map that helps identify golden signals and problems like high latencies, 5xx errors, zombie services, SQL queries. Additionally, it can gather system information and resources via the Prometheus Node Exporter, which is readily available on the agent.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
